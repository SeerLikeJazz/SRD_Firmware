# SRD Firmware

## Description

The simultaneous stimulation-and-recording device (SRD) is a wireless brain-computer interface system designed for use in awake rats. This repository contains firmware for the SRD's MCU. It uses the Cypress Semiconductor's PSoC 3 programmable system on a chip. The firmware project was designed using Cypress's PSoC Creator 3.0.
